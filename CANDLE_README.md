# Candelized DRPreter (Drug Response PREdictor and interpreTER)
DRPreter: Interpretable Anticancer Drug Response Prediction Using Knowledge-Guided Graph Neural Networks and Transformer

This repository introduces the CANDLE-compliant codebase for the DRPreter Model. It is broken into 3 sections.

## 1. Preprocessing

2 scripts are involved in preprocessing.

- `cellline_graph.py`
- `drug_graph.py`

## 2. Training

- 

## 3. Inference
